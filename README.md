Netflix and TV Shows Unsupervised Learning Model
Overview
This repository contains an unsupervised learning model built for analyzing Netflix and TV show data. The purpose of this project is to explore the underlying patterns and relationships among the shows using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of Netflix and TV show information, including show titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and more. The data is collected from various sources and preprocessed for analysis.

Techniques Used
The unsupervised learning model primarily employs the following techniques:

Clustering: The model uses clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar shows based on their attributes, such as genres, ratings, and release dates.
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are used to reduce the data's dimensionality for visualization and insight extraction.
Data Visualization: The results of the model are visualized using plots and charts to explore the clusters and understand show patterns.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed (listed in requirements.txt).
Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the dataset.
Execute the unsupervised_learning_model.py script to apply the clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
Explore the results through the generated visualizations and insights.
Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or want to enhance the model's functionality, feel free to open a pull request.
